Instructions:

CTRL-~ (tilde or backtick-- no need for Shift): Adjust the transparency. There are 5 levels of transparency, including "opaque" and "not displayed".
CTRL-| (pipe or backslash-- no need for Shift): Open a different image. Any image format that MonoGame's Texture2D can display will work.
Escape: Close the tool.

This is a very quick-and-dirty tool. I built this because I wanted to be able to use reference pics while drawing pixel art by hand in Pyxel Edit, which currently doesn't support that.

To compile you will need MonoGame and https://www.nuget.org/packages/OverlayWindow/1.2.0 

Good luck.
